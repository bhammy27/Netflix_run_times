# Netflix_run_times
When speaking with a friend, he suggested that movies are getting shorter and he referenced run times of Netflix documentaries, children movies, and Stand-Up specials as evidence.  Having peaked my interest, I preformed an explortatory data analysis on the netflix_data.csv to understand if all movies are getting shorter over time

## The Analysis

# My conclusion:
- The duration of movies on Netflix has not decreased over the years.
- The creation of more Documentaries, Children shows, and Stand Ups has resulted in more content with short run times.
- Netflix appears to still create the same amount of content with run times over 60 mins in other genres.
